Fix for "Message expired or not available" for MMS while using T-Mobile in Alaksa

When visiting Alaska using a T-Mobile phone when you receive an MMS you may get the message: "Tap to download" and/or "Message expired or not available".  There are many sites on the web that address the issue of MMS not working correctly when the "Message expired or not available" comes up.  I spend many hours trying to find a solution for this.  I tried all of these suggestions but NONE of
them worked:
	
 - Change Your APN Settings
 - Enable MMS Download When Roaming
 - Reset Your Phone
 - Re-install Google Messages
 - Turn off RCS
 - Use another SMS app
 - Turn off Wi-Fi calling
 - Switch to Mobile Data
 - Disable Auto-Retrieve in MMS Setting
 - Enable Download Booster
 - Clear Cache and Data for MMS Service
 - Wipe the Cache Partition
 - Delete Old Messages
 - Reset the APN Settings

When you are in Alaska using T-Mobile you are roaming, using GCI (an Alaskan cell phone company).  There seems to be an incompatibility with T-Mobile and GCI with it comes to MMS.  I did find a non-optimal fix.  It's non-optimal because it only works while on WiFi.  Here are the steps:

 - Turn on Airplane mode
 - Turn on Wifi
 - Turn on WiFi calling: Dialer->Settings->Calls->WiFi Calling

  Now you should be able to get MMS (also SMS and calls).

Obviously, this fix is not so great because as soon as you move away from WiFi, your phone is non-functional.  So you have to remember to turn off Airplane mode when you leave WiFi and follow the above steps when back on WiFi.
